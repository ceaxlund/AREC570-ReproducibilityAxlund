# AREC570-ReproducibilityAxlund
Reproducibility exercise for AREC 570

This file will run by first grabbing the zipped data file from Prof. Bayham's data.
Following this, it will create a directory structure which includes a folder called 'Inputs'
After reading in the 1952-1967 data, a table will be generated which shows the primary columns of data for analysis. 

The code will then add a column which calculates gdp per capita. 
There will then be two plots that are generated, illustrating the change in life expectancy and gdp per capita over time in Canada. 
The final lines will calculate the regressional analysis between predicting life expectancy with GDP per capita.
